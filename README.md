#### Few of the git command that we would use during our upcoming journey

1) git clone reponame  : Download the whole repository
2) git pull : download only the changes
3) git add filename  : Git will start tracking that you're making on the file named filename
4) git coming -m "Message Name " : Adding message to the commit /changes that you made
5) git push    : Your changes will be pushed to the repo

### PS: Ensure you are inside the repo to execute the commands : We will perform clone once and pull multiple times
